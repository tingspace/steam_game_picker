# VDFRuby

A dumb set of utils for working with the Valve [KeyValues](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/KeyValues) data format.

## Notes
- This is something I'm doing in my spare time
- There is a Parser, but it has [some bugs](../../TODO.md)
- This does _not_ validate the KeyValue format
- 
- The idea for the Parser was just to get the basic data out of a VDF file for the purpose of the [Steam Game Picker](../../README.md)
